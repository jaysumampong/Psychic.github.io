Psychic Guessing Game!
* The goal of this game is to guess what the hidden letter the computer has chosen at random.

* Each round the player will get 10 tries.

* After a win or a loss, the amount of guesses the player has resets.

* If the player succesfully guesses the hidden letter, he wins a point.

* Likewise the player will lose if he fails to guess the hidden letter within the set amount of tries.

* There is also a counter that counts which records your key presses and will reset with every round.

* Enjoy the Game!
